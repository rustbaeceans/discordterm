# Discord Terminal Client

A Discord terminal client written entirely in rust.

Clone the repo and run `cargo run` to start.

You can log in with your email/password, or you can use your existing token from the web interface.

Log into discord on chrome, then open the developer tools and copy the token from Application -> Local Storage -> discordapp.com -> token    
Save it, without quotes, into a file called 'token'.

<!-- This requires a Discord login token, which you can get from the web interface. -->
